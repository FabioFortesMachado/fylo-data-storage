# Fylo data storage component

Hello, I took this challenge from the Frontend Mentor website and did it on Flutter. But I tried to make it adapt to as many devices as possible.

Here's the challenge. https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n

I am using the Device Preview package in this project to test on multiple devices. https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview#-readme-tab-

Note: I used the flutter_svg package, to use svg pictures. Keep in mind that this package is not working on the web. If you try to run on chrome it won't work
